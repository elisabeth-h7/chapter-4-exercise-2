# Exercise 2

Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called README.md. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.

In your README.md document, make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in bold), course title (in italics), and instructor name.

Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly.

|**Course Number**|_Course Title_|Instructor's Name
| :---------------| :------------| :--------------
|**15333**        |_Info 201_    |Thomas Winegarden
|**15315**        |_Info 200_    |Scott Barker
|**19258**        |_Scand 150_   |Andy Meyer
